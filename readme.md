# ELMCalc
This is a calculator written using the EFL libraries. It will be a fully featured calculator utility once completed.

In it's current iteration this is somewhat of a quick-and-dirty script. I intend to improve its quality for ease of management and improved speed and appreciate any help you can offer.

# Important Note
The `python-efl` package available on PyPi doesn't install properly, and the devs have not corrected the issue. If you download this project and want to work with the code and need to install the EFL libraries for Python, you will have to either build it from source or use the Debian package.

For Bodhi users, you can install this simply by using:

```sh
~$ sudo apt install python3-efl
```
